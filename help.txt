Here is a guide to our query language!
 
Format for query:
 
Standard query use: ->  command operator attribute
Example: ->  sport == Football
Example: ->  championship >= 1
 
Compound query use standard query format seperated by "and"/"or" for each instance of a query
Example: ->  sport == Football and championship >= 1
 
To query all data use *
Example: ->  *
 
COMMANDS:

       is capitalized and words are separated by spaces)
